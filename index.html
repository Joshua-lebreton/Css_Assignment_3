        <p>
          The H.B. Reese Candy Company was established in 1923 by H. B. Reese in
          Hershey, Pennsylvania. The official product name was "Penny Cups"
          because they could be purchased for one cent. Reese had originally
          worked at a Hershey dairy farm, and from the start, he used Hershey
          chocolate in his confections. Reese's Peanut Butter Cups were his most
          popular candy, leading Reese to eventually discontinue his other
          lines. Reese died in 1956, passing the company to his six sons,
          Robert, John, Ed, Ralph, Harry, and Charles Richard Reese. On July 2,
          1963, the Reese brothers merged the H. B. Reese Candy Company with the
          Hershey Chocolate Corporation in a tax-free stock-for-stock merger. In
          1969, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups became the Hershey Company's top
          seller.<br /><br />

          The H.B. Reese Candy Company is maintained as a subsidiary of Hershey
          because the Reese plant workforce is not unionized, unlike the main
          Hershey plant. In 2012, Reese's was the best-selling candy brand in
          the United States with sales of $2.603 billion, and was the
          fourth-best-selling candy brand globally with sales of $2.679
          billion—only $76 million (2.8%) of its sales were from outside the
          United States market. Additionally, the H.B. Reese Candy Company
          manufactures the Kit Kat in the United States, which had 2012 U.S.
          sales of $948 million.<br /><br />

          As of October 2017, in the U.S. convenience store channel, Reese's was
          the largest confection brand by far: It was 62% larger than the next
          brand, with more households purchasing Reese's products than any other
          confection brand across the United States. Reese's includes the
          overall top-selling confection item—the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups
          King Size—as well as six of the top 20 chocolate/non-chocolate items.
          Additionally, the Reese's brand accounts for over 47% of all seasonal
          sales within the U.S. convenience store channel, including the top two
          items in the largest four commercial seasons: Valentine's, Easter,
          Halloween, and Christmas. As a comparison, the next largest brand
          accounts for only 10% of seasonal sales. In 2024, the Reese brothers'
          original 666,316 shares of Hershey common stock represent 16 million
          Hershey shares valued at over $4.4 billion that pay annual cash
          dividends of $87.6 million.

          In the United States, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups typically come in
          packs of 2, 4, 5, 10 or 20 in distinctive orange packaging, set on
          thin but rigid paperboard trays. The "Classic" two-pack is a 0.75
          ounces <span class="gram">(21 g)</span> cup since 2001 (originally a
          0.9 ounces <span class="gram">(26 g)</span> size, reduced to 0.8
          ounces <span class="gram">(23 g)</span> in 1991), the "King Size"
          four-pack introduced in the early 1980s is a 0.7 ounces
          <span class="gram">(20 g)</span> cup (originally a 0.8 ounces
          <span class="gram">(23 g)</span> cup until 1991) and the "Lunch"
          eight-pack is a 0.55 ounces <span class="gram">(16 g)</span> cup.
          "Large Size" packs of three 0.7 oz cups, as well as bags containing
          0.6 ounces <span class="gram">(17 g)</span> cups, are also available.
          Reese's Miniatures come in various bag sizes and foil colors for
          seasonal themes like red, gold and green for the Christmas holiday
          season.<br /><br />

          In Canada, they at one point were packaged as Reese Peanut Butter
          Cups, but were still widely referred to by their American name. The
          possessive name is recognized only in English grammar, so it was
          removed to make the name bilingual in Canada. Previously packaged in a
          two pack, they now come in a standard pack of three 0.55 oz. cups or
          the king-size variation with four cups. In the United Kingdom and
          Ireland, they were originally available only in two-packs, though are
          now available in three-packs, five-packs and miniatures. In 2008,
          Reese's Peanut Butter Cups were made available in Europe by Hydro
          Texaco and 7-Eleven. In Australia, Reese's products can be found in
          many specialty candy stores, as well as from American stores such as
          Costco.<br /><br />

          In the 1970s and 1980s, a series of commercials were run for Reese's
          Peanut Butter Cups featuring situations in which two people, one
          eating peanut butter and one eating chocolate, collided. One person
          would exclaim, "You got your peanut butter on my chocolate!" and the
          other would exclaim, "You got your chocolate in my peanut butter!"
          They would then sample the mixture and remark on the great taste,
          tying in with the slogan "Two great tastes that taste great
          together."<br /><br />

          In the 1990s, the product's slogan was: "There's no wrong way to eat a
          Reese's."<br /><br />

          Reese's was an associate sponsor of NASCAR Cup Series drivers Mark
          Martin (1994) and Kevin Harvick (2007–2010).

            Reese's Peanut Butter Cups" but was changed to White Reese's or

          </li>
        </ul>

        <br /><span class="bold">Holiday editions</span> <br />During the
        seasons when retailers offer holiday-themed candies, Reese's Peanut
        Butter candies are available in various shapes that still offer the
        standard confection theme of the traditional Reese's cup (peanut butter
        contained in a chocolate shell). They are sold in a 6-pack packaging
        configuration but are usually available individually. Although exterior
        packaging is altered to reflect the theme of the representative holiday,
        the actual holiday itself is never presented.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Reese's Peanut Butter Hearts: Available mainly during January and
            February, these are heart-shaped confections representing
            Valentine's Day. At various retailers, an individually-packaged,
            larger heart is available as well. These are packaged in all-red
            exterior packaging. Launched nationally in 1997.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reese's Peanut Butter Eggs: Available mainly during March and April,
            these are egg-shaped confections representing Easter. Exterior
            packaging is usually yellow and orange (milk chocolate), white and
            orange (white chocolate), or dark brown and orange (fudge-flavored
            chocolate). This is the only holiday-themed item available in three
            chocolate varieties.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins: Available mainly during September
            and October, these are pumpkin-shaped confections representing
            Halloween. The packaging is standard Reese's orange with a
            jack-o-lantern picture and the word "Pumpkins" prominently
            displayed. Launched nationally in 1993. White Creme pumpkins were
            added to the Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkin line in 2017.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reese's Peanut Butter Ghosts: Available mainly during September and
            October, these are ghost-shaped confections representing Halloween.
            The packaging is Halloween themed with the word scary on it. The
            ghost replaces the letter "a" in the word scary. First released in
            2016.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reese's Peanut Butter Franken-Cup: Released in 2020, Hershey's first
            colored Reese's variation. It consists of milk chocolate, white
            crème that is dyed green, and the traditional peanut butter filling.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reese's Peanut Butter Bats: Available in September and October,
            these are bat-shaped chocolate candies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reese's Peanut Butter Christmas Trees: Available mainly during
            November and December, these are evergreen tree-shaped confections
            representing Christmas. At various retailers these may be available
            in standard milk chocolate or white. Initially, the packaging was
            green, white, and orange, but has been changed to a winter scene
            with a snow-covered ground and a snowman with a central large orange
            evergreen tree-shape in the center of the package. In November 2015,
            consumers criticized the product via Twitter for bearing too vague a
            resemblance to a Christmas tree.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <span class="semi-bold"
